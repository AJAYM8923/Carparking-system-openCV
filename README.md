ðŸš— AI Enabled Car Parking System using OpenCV

Excited to share a mini project from my college daysâ€”a smart car parking system leveraging OpenCV and Flask! This project utilizes image processing techniques to detect vehicles in real-time from a provided .mp4 video file.

Key Features:
Vehicle Detection: OpenCV is employed to detect vehicles within parking spots.

Real-time Status: Parking spots are dynamically marked as booked (red) or available (green) based on vehicle presence.

Vacant Spot Count: The system displays the number of available parking slots in real-time, providing convenient monitoring.

This project not only honed my skills in computer vision and web development but also demonstrated practical applications of AI in everyday scenarios. Looking forward to exploring more innovations in AI and contributing to future projects!
